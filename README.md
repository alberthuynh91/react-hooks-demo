This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React Hooks Demo

This is a short demo I created showing the differences between a react class component using state versus a react functional component using hooks.

You can start the project by running `npm start`

Hooks.js is the functional react hooks implementation
WithoutHooks.js is the class implementation

You can see that I am importing both `<Hooks />` and `<WithoutHooks />` components in `App.js`. Comment one or the other to see them in action. Both components should function identically. The only difference is their implementation of state.
